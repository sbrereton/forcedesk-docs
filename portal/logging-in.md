Once you have imported your staff, they will be able to use their email address to sign in.

When they attempt to use any function on the Dashboard it will prompt them to sign-in.

They will then get a magic link to their email address that will let them finish signing in. They will not have to enter a password for up to two weeks if they use the same browser again.

Note: Some users can use a username and password if you have set one for them.
