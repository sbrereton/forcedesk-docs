The Dashboard contains a general view of a user's profile such as their number of Open vs. Closed Tickets.

From here they can submit issues to your Helpdesk Team.

## User Dashboard

The user dashboard will display a list of the user's open and closed tickets.

If configured, the Dashboard can display a user's Papercut PIN and Balance. This integration will need to be setup via the Admin Console first and the user's staff code (Username) will need to match that of Papercut's entry for that user.
